What is the difference between struct and class?
(from reddit) The biggest difference is the defailt access. 
Class has everything private by default, and a struct has everything public

Why do we need our class to be derived from the TObject?
(from CERN site) It provides default behaviour and protocol for all objects
in the ROOT system.  It provides protocol for object I/O, error handling, sorting, 
inspection, printing, drawing, etc. Every object which inherits from TObject can be
stored in the ROOT collection classes.
